# Pathogen-Genomics-in-Public-Health
The goal of this repository is to consolidate workflows for various pathogens, categorized by the disease they cause, and create a pathogen-agnostic platform that supports researchers, public health professionals, and epidemiologists in efforts to detect, track, and respond to infectious disease threats. Some of the pathogens are guided by the WHO Priority Pathogen List for epidemic threats.

## Introduction
Welcome to the Pathogen-Genomics-in-Public-Health repository. This repository aims to provide comprehensive workflows for a wide range of pathogens, categorized by the diseases they cause. It is designed to be a valuable resource for researchers, public health professionals, and epidemiologists to enhance their efforts in detecting, tracking, and responding to infectious disease threats.

  - *Salmonella* spp.
  - *Escherichia coli* (E. coli)
  - *Listeria monocytogenes*
  - *Vibrio cholerae*
- **Viruses**:

  - *Herpes Simplex Virus* (HSV)
- **Bacteria**:
  - *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*

Vaccine-preventable diseases are infectious diseases for which an effective preventive vaccine exists.
- **Viruses**:
  - *Measles Virus*
  - *Rubella Virus*
  - *Mumps Virus*
  - *Hepatitis B Virus*
- **Bacteria**:
  - *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* (Diphtheria)

## Zoonotic Diseases
Zoonotic diseases are diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans.
- **Viruses**:
  - *Ebola Virus*
  - *Hantaviruses*
  - *Mpox virus*
- **Bacteria**:
  - *Brucella* spp. (Brucellosis)
  - *Bacillus anthracis* (Anthrax)

## Gastrointestinal Diseases
Gastrointestinal diseases are infections that affect the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Viruses**:
  - *Rotavirus*
  - *Norovirus*
- **Bacteria**:
  - *Escherichia coli* (E. coli)
  - *Salmonella* spp.
